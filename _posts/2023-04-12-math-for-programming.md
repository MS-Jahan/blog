What mathematical concepts are utilized by computer programmers?
================================================================

On his first day of university class, the professor asked the students why mathematics is necessary. Many answers were given, but the professor made a logical point: "Perhaps the numbers themselves won't be directly useful, but they will greatly enhance the brain's ability to think logically, which is essential for programming." Programming is entirely dependent on logic, and developing logical skills requires the use of various algorithms. Here are some commonly used math concepts:

*   Addition
*   Subtraction
*   Multiplication or Product
*   Division
*   Modulo (%)
*   Exponentiation (power) (pow)
*   Absolute values (abs)
*   Rounding Off
*   Ceiling Rounding (Ceil)
*   Floor Rounding (floor)
*   Pythagorean Theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)
*   Fractions (Floating point) (How floating point works)
*   Arithmetic Sequence (1, 2, 3, ...)
*   Geometric Sequence (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ...)
*   Finding the sum of numbers (for loops / arithmetic sequences)
*   Binary numbers
*   Hexadecimal numbers
*   Octal numbers
*   Factorial
*   Function
*   Recursive Function (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, Factorial of a number)
*   Maximum value / upper limit / lower limit of integer specified bytes (32-bit vs. 64-bit)
*   Floating point exceptions (epsilon, division by zero, infinity)
*   Square Root (sqrt / pow (x, 1/2))
*   String (actually, a set of 8-bit numbers)
*   Set
*   Hash Function
*   Table (e.g., Division Table, Log Table)
*   Signedness (e.g., +123, -123)
*   Comparison of numbers
*   Bit Manipulation (And, Or, Xor, Not, Xnor, Neg, Nand, Nor, Left Shift, Right Shift)
*   Boolean Algebra (true or false)
*   Logic (&&, ||, ==)
*   Geometry (hyperplanes, points at infinity, etc.)
*   Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan, asine, etn2, etc.)
*   Vector (Cartesian)
*   Matrix
*   Quaternions
*   Graph theory
*   Number theory
*   Calculus
*   Probability
*   Fourier series

These concepts are based on the answer provided by Md. Zubair (Lecturer | Data Science Researcher | Computer engineer) with some additional items. If you wish to work in machine learning, you will require knowledge of Probability, Statistics, Matrix, Vector, Calculus, and other related topics.
